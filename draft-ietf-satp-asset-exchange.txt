                     Secure Asset Exchange Protocol
                 draft-ietf-satp-asset-exchange-latest

Abstract

   This document describes the Secure Asset Exchange Protocol (SAEP).
   SAEP is a protocol operating between two gateways that coordinate the
   atomic exchange of digital assets in two different asset networks.

1.  Introduction

   TBD: Introduce the asset exchange protocol as a core requirement for
   interoperability between asset networks, primarily blockchains and
   DLTs, and as a natural extension to the SATP.  Cite the earlier SATP
   drafts for reference [SATA] [SATP] [SATU].

2.  Terminology

   The following are some terminology used in the current document.  We
   borrow terminology from [NIST] and [ISO] as much as possible,
   introducing new terms only when needed:

   *  Asset network (system): The network or system where a digital
      asset is utilized.

   *  Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP): The protocol used to
      transfer (move) a digital asset from one network to another using
      gateways.

   *  Origin network: The current network where the digital asset is
      located.

   *  Destination network: The network to which a digital asset is to be
      transferred.

   *  Data sharing: The process, using the Asset Transfer Protocol, by
      which one or more units of verifiably authentic data are
      communicated from an Origin network to a Destination network,
      either voluntarily or upon request.

   *  Asset Transfer: A fail-safe process of moving an asset from one
      network to another, with the destruction of the asset in the
      Origin network and its recreation in the Destination network
      occurring as a single atomic action.

   *  Asset Exchange: A fail-safe process of exchanging (or swapping)
      assets held by a pair of owners, each asset being maintained in a
      different network, with the two in-network transfers occurring as
      a single atomic action.

3.  Security Considerations

   TBD: List security considerations, if any.

4.  IANA Considerations

   TBD: Does this document require any IANA actions?
